# Contributing to Pliny

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Pliny!

Please make sure to follow these simple guidelines when opening a pull request:

- Try to include tests for any features added or modified.
- Follow the style conventions of the surrounding code. It's mostly the same as [GitHub's styleguide for Ruby](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).
  - Use the new style for hashes (`foo: 42` instead of `:foo => 42`).
- Keep in mind Pliny is MIT licensed, so all code you contribute with should be, too.
